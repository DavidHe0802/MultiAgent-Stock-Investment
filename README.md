## Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock_investment_pipeline.git
   cd stock_investment_pipeline
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   ```
   python database/build_database.py
   ```
   This will create and populate the SQLite database with initial stock data.

5. **Run the simulation:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application. It initializes the `OfficeSimulation` class and starts the daily investment cycle.

## Main Components

### main.py
This is the entry point of the application. It typically contains code to:
- Initialize the Portfolio
- Create an instance of the OfficeSimulation
- Start the daily investment cycle
- Handle any high-level error logging or reporting

Example content of `main.py`:

```python
from office.office_simulation import OfficeSimulation
from models.portfolio import Portfolio
import time

if __name__ == "__main__":
    portfolio = Portfolio()
    office = OfficeSimulation(portfolio)
    
    while True:
        try:
            daily_report = office.run_daily_cycle()
            print(daily_report)
            # Wait for next day (you might want to implement a proper scheduling mechanism)
            time.sleep(86400)  # Sleep for 24 hours
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
            # Implement error handling and reporting here
```

### requirements.txt
This file lists all the Python packages required to run the project. It typically includes:

```
yfinance
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sqlite3
openai
```

To add or update dependencies, you can modify this file and then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies

The main dependencies for this project include:
- yfinance: For fetching stock data
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For data visualization
- sqlite3: For database operations (included in Python standard library)
- openai: For AI-powered decision making and analysis

Refer to `requirements.txt` for the complete list of dependencies and their versions.

## Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
- The simulation runs continuously by default. You may want to implement a more sophisticated scheduling system for production use.
- Make sure to keep your API keys and sensitive data secure. Consider using environment variables for API keys.

## Future Improvements

- Implement more sophisticated AI models for decision making
- Add real-time data streaming capabilities
- Develop a web interface for monitoring the simulation
- Implement backtesting functionality to evaluate strategy performance
- Enhance error handling and logging mechanisms
- Add unit tests and integration tests for better code reliability
